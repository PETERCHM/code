DJANGO PRODUCT REVIEW SYSTEM

DESCRIPTION

 The Django Product Review System is a web application built using Django, a Python web framework. It provides a platform for users to submit reviews for products, rate them, provide feedback, and engage in discussions through comments. The system also includes features like moderation, notifications, and reporting.

The application uses a set of models defined in the models.py file to represent the core entities in the system, such as User, Product, Review, Rating, Feedback, Comment, Report, Moderation, and Notification. These models define the structure of the database tables and the relationships between them.

To interact with the application, a set of API endpoints is provided in the views.py file. These endpoints handle operations like submitting a review, retrieving reviews for a specific product, getting review details, and updating existing reviews. The views utilize Django's JsonResponse to return responses in JSON format.

Usage
The following endpoints are available for interacting with the API:

POST /reviews/submit/ - Submit a new review.

GET /reviews/ - Retrieve a list of reviews for a specific product.

GET /reviews/{review_id}/ - Retrieve the details of a specific review.

PUT /reviews/{review_id}/ - Update an existing review.
